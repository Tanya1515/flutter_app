# flutter_app
This repo is a test app, that was built using Flutter and Supabase. It was based on [QuickStart of Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-flutter).
The app is going to register users and show all added information, if email and password are correct.

## Project set up: 
- Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Set up [Supabase locally](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development);
- Create table (clients) with the following fields: name, surname, phone, city, country.

## Start the application: 
- Run the following command, then choose a platform:
```
flutter run
```

- Or for web, run the following command to launch it on localhost:3000:
```
flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname localhost --web-port 3000
```

- In order to launch on Android, use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app)
